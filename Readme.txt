Programming Language Used: Python3

Code Structure:
It contains 4 files:
1) main.py - it is main file for program to run
2) Kmeans.py - it contains kmeans algorithm
3) knn.py - it contains knn algorithm
4) requirements.txt - it has list of required python libraries

How to run the code?
Make sure that supporting files - "Kmeans.py", "knn.py", "requirements.txt" and data file - "NBAstats.csv" are in same folder in which main file - "main.py" is.
Then install all required python libraries for code by typing below command:
pip install -r requirements.txt OR sudo pip install -r requirements.txt (to run as admin)
Just run normally on command line as every python code does based on your system configuration, below is an example:
python main.py OR python3 main.py

What it shows?
It will show total 4 outputs:
1) Kmeans centers for k={3,5} with all columns for question 2 of problem 1
2) Kmeans centers for k={3,5} with columns specified in question 4 of problem 1
3) Knn accuracy with k = {1,5,10,30} with all columns for question 2 of problem 2
4) Knn accuracy with k = {1,5,10,30} with columns specified in question 3 of problem 2
